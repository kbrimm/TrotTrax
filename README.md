### Project Status
As of Friday, August 14, TrotTrax has reached a point where it posesses most of its required functionaity. Missing features are detailed in the issues tab. For interested parties, I've included a .zip with Windows binaries in case you wanted to click around in the interface for a bit. Do take note, though, that there is an upcoming database refactor that will wipe out any data you save in this "demo-lite" version.

Thank you so much for your interest in TrotTrax!

### What Is It?
TrotTrax is a desktop application to track membership, financial information, and show points for small or nonprofit horse and pony clubs. Implemented in C# with a SQL database.

### The Story
I grew up in a semi-rural environment with a family full of horse people. My mother still volunteers for her local horse and pony club, the Black Hawk Creek Saddle Club. As their volunteer "points person", she sifts through an unwieldy pile of papers and manages a behemoth spreadsheet to keep track of who's a paid member, who has how many points, and who owes or is owed money.

### The Goal
This initial version of TrotTrax is intended to make that job easier. The BHCSC's requirements dictate that the application run on a Windows computer, offer an intranet-accessible database (in the absence of an internet connection), and generate printable reports.

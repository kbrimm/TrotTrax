### Project Status
TrotTrax now has its own official website: [trottrax.org](http://www.trottrax.org/)

### What Is It?
TrotTrax is a desktop application to track membership, financial information, and show points for small or nonprofit horse and pony clubs. Implemented in C# with a SQLite database.

### The Story
I grew up in a semi-rural environment with a family full of horse people. My mother still volunteers for her local horse and pony club, the Black Hawk Creek Saddle Club. As their volunteer "points person", she sifts through an unwieldy pile of papers and manages a behemoth spreadsheet to keep track of who's a paid member, who has how many points, and who owes or is owed money.

### The Goal
This initial version of TrotTrax is intended to make that job easier. The BHCSC's requirements dictate that the application run on a Windows computer, offer an intranet-accessible database (in the absence of an internet connection), and generate printable reports.
